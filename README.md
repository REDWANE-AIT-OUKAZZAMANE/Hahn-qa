```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd client
npm install
cd ..
```

### 3. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
PROD_MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/crudapp
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
EMAIL_SECRET=your_email_secret_key_here
NODE_ENV=development
PROD_CLIENT=http://localhost:3000
PORT=4000
EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
PASS=your_email_password
```

### 4. Install Test Dependencies

```bash
# Install Playwright for E2E testing
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install
```

### 5. Start the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend server
npm start

# Terminal 2: Start frontend application
cd client
npm start
```

The application will be available at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend**: http://localhost:4000

### 6. Run Tests âœ… WORKING

```bash
# Run smoke tests (RECOMMENDED - 3 tests passing)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/smoke.spec.js --headed

# Run smoke tests in headless mode
npx playwright test tests/e2e/smoke.spec.js

# Run E2E tests with interactive UI
npx playwright test --ui

# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed
